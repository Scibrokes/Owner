  - R version (short form): `r getRversion()`
  - [**rmarkdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) package version: `r packageVersion('rmarkdown')`
  - File version: 1.0.1
  - File latest updated date: `r Sys.Date()`
  - Author Profile: [®γσ, Eng Lian Hu](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/englianhu/ryo-eng/)
  - GitHub: [Source Code](https://github.com/scibrokes/owner)
  - Additional session information

```{r info, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
suppressMessages(require('dplyr', quietly = TRUE))
suppressMessages(require('formattable', quietly = TRUE))

lubridate::now()
sys1 <- devtools::session_info()$platform %>% unlist %>% data.frame(Category = names(.), session_info = .)
rownames(sys1) <- NULL
sys1 %>% formattable %>% as.htmlwidget

data.frame(Sys.info = Sys.info()) %>% formattable %>% as.htmlwidget

rm(sys1)
```
